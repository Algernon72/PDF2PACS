üìÇ PDF2PACS  

**PDF2PACS** is a lightweight desktop application that allows healthcare professionals to easily upload PDF documents into a PACS archive.  
It encapsulates PDFs as DICOM objects and sends them via C-STORE to the configured PACS.

üìñ Extended Description  

ü©∫ For End Users (Radiologists, Technicians, Clinicians)  
**PDF2PACS** is a user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify the integration of non-DICOM documents into radiology workflows.  
With just a few clicks, healthcare professionals can upload PDF reports, scanned papers, or administrative documents directly into the PACS archive.  

The application automatically encapsulates PDF files into the DICOM format, so they can be stored and viewed in the same system as imaging studies. Supporting both single and multiple file uploads, **PDF2PACS** ensures that external reports are seamlessly attached to the patient‚Äôs imaging record, keeping all relevant information centralized and accessible within the PACS.  

  Why it‚Äôs useful:**  
- Centralizes all patient-related data (images + documents)  
- Simplifies workflows for radiology staff  
- Reduces reliance on paper archives and external storage  
- Ensures consistency and accessibility of patient history

 üíª For Developers & Integrators  
**PDF2PACS** is implemented in Python and simulates a DICOM modality to transfer PDF files as *Encapsulated PDF* objects using the DICOM C-STORE protocol.  

**Technical highlights:**  
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Dependencies:** `pydicom`, `requests`, `tkinter` (UI), optional packaging with `pyinstaller`  
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Select one or more PDF files through the GUI  
  2. Each PDF is wrapped into a valid DICOM object with configurable metadata (Patient Name, ID, Study Description, Series Description)  
  3. Objects are sent to the target PACS via C-STORE SCU  
- **Configurable settings:**  
  - PACS IP, Port, and AE Title  
  - Default DICOM metadata values  
- **Extensible:** Developers can easily adapt the code to handle other document types (e.g., JPEG, DOCX ‚Üí encapsulated as DICOM) or integrate with custom hospital systems  

This makes the project suitable both as a production tool in small/medium radiology departments and as a learning resource for developers exploring DICOM communication and PACS integration.

üöÄ Installation  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf2pacs.git
cd pdf2pacs
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

*(If tkinter is not included in your Python distribution, install it separately according to your OS.)*

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python Modality_pdf_uploader.py
```

Steps:

1. Launch the application
2. Configure PACS settings (IP, Port, AE Title) in the settings menu
3. Select one or more PDF files
4. Click **Invia a Orthanc** to encapsulate and send to PACS

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions  

The project includes a ready-to-use **`.spec`** file and a **`.bat`** script to simplify the build process with PyInstaller.  
These allow you to generate a smaller executable that depends on external files, instead of a large one-file binary.  

### üîπ Build with the provided `.bat` script  
Simply run:  

```bash
build_small_exe.bat
````

This will call PyInstaller using the two provided `.spec` files and create the executables inside the `dist/` folder.

### üìÇ Output

* The compiled **exe** will be created in the `dist/` directory
* The required resource files will be placed in the same folder structure defined in the `.spec` file
* Keep the `.exe` and the resource files together in the same directory for the application to run correctly

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

* The `.bat` script assumes that Python and PyInstaller are installed and available in your PATH
* If you prefer a fully self-contained executable (larger size), you can still use:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole pdf2pacs.py
```

```

Vuoi che ti prepari anche un esempio di **build.bat** e di **pdf2pacs.spec** minimale da mettere nel repo, cos√¨ il README √® subito coerente con i file?
